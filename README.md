# bad-credit-problem
My first project at the university in c #.
Task:

Write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports whether it is a valid American Express,
MasterCard, or Visa card number, per the definitions of each’s format herein. We ask that your program’s last line of
output be AMEX\n or MASTERCARD\n or VISA\n or INVALID\n , nothing more, nothing less.
For simplicity, you may assume that the user’s input will be entirely numeric (i.e., devoid of hyphens, as might be printed
on an actual card). But do not assume that the user’s input will fit in an int!
